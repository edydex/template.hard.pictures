Will make a walkthrough of how to make your own photoalbums page based on this template. 
Steps to set up your own:
1. Change Page Title and Page name (<h1>***</h1>)
2. Replace "profilePic.jpg" with your own (later on I will make it as easy as uploading a picture to some website and pasting a link into prompt)
3. Paste your photo album folders in (at the moment this doesn't support subfolders within folders)
4. Run "addAlbums.py" to populate the website with your album folders and populate the albums
5. Open index.html to check the results - if you like them - push them.

To add more albums to your page just upload the folder into this directory and run addAlbums.py

To change the profile picture just replace profilePic.jpg with your own.
At some point I will add a script that customizes your page - changes your profile name, tab title, and your links.
The script will also allow you to choose if you want to keep the header "hard.pictures"
